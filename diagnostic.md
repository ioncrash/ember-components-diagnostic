# Ember Components Diagnostic

Record your responses inside the fenced code blocks below each question.

1.  Give an example of a visual hierarchy that could be modeled with components. Explain why each piece might be it's own component.

    ```md
    On the top layer you could have a store, below that a component called product-categories, which you may want to reuse because you'll have many kinds of products in each store. Below that you could have products, which should be their own component because each category will have many products (and in both cases I'll want to reuse my code)
    ```

1.  What is the command to generate a new component called '`my-map`'?

    ```sh
    ember g component my-map
    ```

1.  What files are created and/or edited to produce a component, and what are their responsibilities?

    ```md
    A component file, which contains object data as well as actions and class bindings, and a template file, which determines how the component should be rendered
    ```

1.  Suppose you have a component '`my-contact`', which is loaded from
    '`app/contacts/template.hbs`' when visiting the `/contacts` route. What is
    the syntax (code that is written) to render this component inside that template?

    ```html
    {{my-contact}}
    ```

1.  Each contact has multiple phone numbers. Suppose you also have '`my-phone`'
    nested under '`my-contact`'. What is the code you would write in
    '`app/components/my-contact/template.hbs`' to load the nested component and
    pass it data?

    ```html
    {{my-contact/my-phone data=data}}
    ```
